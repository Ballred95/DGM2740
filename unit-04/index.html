              <p>Bears are large mammals that eat mostly
                meat and fish. Many bears also eat plants,
                bulbs, and insects.
                The polar bear eats mostly meat and is
                classified as carnivores, while the panda feeds
                almost entirely on bamboo and is classified as
                a herbivore. The six other species of bear eat
                both plants and animals and are classified as omnivorous.</p>
